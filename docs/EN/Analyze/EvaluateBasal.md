## Evaluate Basal Tips

### Nightscout

Nightscout (NS) is one tool that will provide more info for analysis. You will want to focus on the amount of IOB at the valleys. It should rise with negative IOB and drop with positive. Adjust gradually to make that happen most of the time. Changing basal for the previous several hours by 0.05 U/h will typically change IOB by 0.2 - 0.3 units. This will depend on DIA.

<b>Which Nightscout view is most helpful?</b>

The standard default view when scrolling to the valleys is best for the last 24 hours (no IOB is displayed after that).
Day-to-day reports if looking at older data (remember to check the IOB box, and optionally COB for meal-related analysis).

<b>How to adjust basal rate?</b>

All hours before the time you are looking at (within DIA hours) are adjusted. If you change only some of the previous hours, you can make more minor adjustments to the resulting IOB. You can also adjust one step up and down every other hour so the average is in between available rates.
