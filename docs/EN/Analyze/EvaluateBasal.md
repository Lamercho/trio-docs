<b>Nightscout</b>
Nightscout (NS) is one tool that will provide more info for analysis. You will want to focus on the amount of IOB at the valleys. It should rise with negative IOB, and drop with positive. Adjust gradually to make that happen most of the time. Changing basal for the previous several hours by 0.05 U/h will typically change IOB by 0.2 - 0.3 units. This will depend on DIA.

<b>So, which Nightscout view is most helpful?</b>
The normal default view when scrolling to the valleys is best for the last 24 hours (no IOB is displayed after that).
Day to day reports if looking at older data (remember to check the IOB box, and optionally COB for meal related analysis).

<b>How to adjust basal rate?</b>
All hours before the time you are looking at (within DIA hours) are adjusted. If you adjust only some of the previous hours, you can make smaller adjustments to the resulting IOB. You can also adjust every other hour one step up and down, so the average is in between available rates.
