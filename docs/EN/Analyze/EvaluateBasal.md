To evaluate basals, you should focus on whether IOB is negative or positive as glucose readings change. Glucose readings should rise with negative IOB and fall with positive IOB. Glucose readings continuing to drop with negative IOB indicate that basal rates may be too high.

### Using Nightscout

Nightscout (NS) is a valuable resource that provides detailed information for analyzing your .
When scrolling to the valleys, the standard default view is best for the last 24 hours (no IOB is displayed afterward).
Day-to-day reports if looking at older data (remember to check the IOB box, and optionally COB for meal-related analysis).

### How to adjust basal rate?

All hours before the time you are looking at (within DIA hours) are adjusted. If you change only some of the previous hours, you can make more minor adjustments to the resulting IOB. You can adjust one step up and down every other hour so the average is between available rates.
