# New User Setup
To set up your Trio app, touch the settings icon located on the bottom right of the main screen. Follow this step-by-step guide to start using Trio. Each step contains links to information on setting up each part of your Trio app. Use this as your homebase to reference back to as you set up your app.

## Step 1: Connect your Devices

## Step 2: Add Profile Settings

## Step 3: Adjust Preferences

## Step 4: Enable Closed Loop
Closed loop is turned off by default. This means Trio cannot make adjustments automatically. The system relies solely on you to make any recommended adjustments while Closed Loop is OFF. You can control your pump and bolus with the Trio app, but nothing will be done without your approval while in "open loop."

## Step 5: Change App Icon (Optional)
