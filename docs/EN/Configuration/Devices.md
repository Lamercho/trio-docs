# Devices
Adding devices to Open-iAPS is easy. You can only have one pump and one CGM active simultaneously. If you want to switch to another pump or CGM, delete the current device first. When you select a device, you will be guided through its setup with an on-screen guide.

## Pump
This section allows you to select your insulin delivery system. For more information on supported pumps, see the following [link](../Getting-Started/pump.md). Omnipod Eros and older Medtronic devices don't support Bluetooth. These devices require a Rileylink, OrangeLink, or EmaLink to translate communication between your phone's Bluetooth signals and the pump's radio communication signals.

During pump setup, you will be asked to choose your insulin type. This will determine your duration of insulin action and peak action time. These settings can be changed later.

## CGM
This section allows you to choose your glucose data source. Most options are self-explanatory. For more information on compatible CGMs, please look at the following [link](../settings/devices/cgm.md).

### Changing transmitter on Dexcom G6

If you are using a Dexcom G6 sensor, you must remember to change your transmitter ID in the Open-iAPS app whenever you change transmitters.

### Changing Dexcom G6 or G7 sensor

Change the sensor through the Dexcom G6 or G7 app. Open-iAPS will automatically pick up the reading; you don't need to do anything else.

### xDrip as BG source

xDrip is not recommended with the Open-iAPS app, as native connections to CGM are more stable.

## Watch
This section allows you to add a watch to Open-iAPS. Apple Watch and some Garmin watches are compatible. An Apple Watch will allow you to add carbs and bolus, set a temporary target from your watch, and show BG, IOB, COB, etc. Garmin watches only display data and will not let you interact by adding carbs or insulin.
