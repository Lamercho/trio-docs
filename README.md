Tips & Tricks: (please add!)

* Using the # sign shows a chapter on the menu/index. The amount of #'s determin the level. If you don't want a chapter to end up in the menu/index, use bold text by adding ** or using < b > before the text and < / b > after the text (without spaces).
* When linking to other md files that are in another directory, the link must start with ../ - example: ../directoryname/filename.md
